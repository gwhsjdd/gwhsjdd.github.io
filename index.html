    <h1>What is GIT FETCH?</h1>
    <h2>This is a Git command that updates changes in a remote repository without making any changes to your local repository.
         It simply downloads a new commit or branch, allowing you to see the changes on the server, but does not affect your current files.
         you can use it without fear that something might break </h2>
    
    <h2>DIFFERENCE between GIT FETCH and GIT PULL is that when you're using git pull , you're making some changes in your remote repository it will immediately appear in local repository,
        while git fetch will update changes in a remote repository without making any changes
    </h2>


    <h1>What is GIT REBASE?</h1>
    <h2>This is a Git command that can help to make history of commits more readable and clear.
        When you're making changes in branch and someone making own changes in another branch,
         by using "git rebase" you can put own commits after smn's commit,and it will look like you had made them after smn's changes.
         This helps keep the project history clean and consistent </h2>

    <h2>DIFFERENCE between GIT REBASE and GIT MERGE is Rebasing puts your feature branch at the beginning of the main branch to create a linear history,
         while a merging is a safe alternative that keeps your repository's whole history unchanged. .</h2>

    <h1>WHAT IS WORKFLOW?</h1>
    <h2>a commonly used version control system that provides Git guidelines for getting work done consistently and productively.
        It is needed to simplify the coordination of work in a team when working, especially on large projects.
    </h2>
